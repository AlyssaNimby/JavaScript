# To-Do List App


Created a simple To-Do List App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using this To Do list, we can add our task list and mark them as completed or incomplete. 
Adding a new task to the list is as simple as typing it in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
A close icon is also available to be able to delete a particular task from the list.
